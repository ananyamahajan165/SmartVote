## 📌 Project Description

SmartVote is a web-based digital voting system developed to simplify and secure the voting process. 
The project ensures voter authenticity, prevents multiple voting by the same user, and maintains accurate vote records using a database-backed system.

It provides separate interfaces for voters and administrators, allowing administrators to manage elections and monitor results efficiently while ensuring transparency and data integrity.

The system is designed for small-scale elections such as college elections, organizational voting, and internal polls, offering a reliable alternative to traditional paper-based voting.
